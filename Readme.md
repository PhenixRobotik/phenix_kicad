# KiCAD Libraries for PhenixRobotik

This repository contains KiCAD 5.0 compatible libraries for the PhenixRobotik boards.

* `library/`

  contains the schematics.

* `modules/`

  contains pcb footprints.
  Some schematics may use standard footprints, so they won't be present here.

* `modules/packages3d/`

  contains 3d packages for visualization purposes


Please verify the compliancy of the libraries before committing ;)
